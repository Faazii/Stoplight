# One-On-One Appointment-Service

### One-On-One Appointment service is usually for a single attendee per time slot. It facilitates your clients to quickly make their reservations directly from your website based on their preferred time slot. One-on-One booking is primarily used by interviewers, therapists, personal trainers, pet care professionals, government and embassies, and all other individual appointment-based businesses. 
### With GoScheduleâ€™s 1:1 Appointment Service API, you will be able to get, define your service, add your location and duration of the appointment, and associate it with cost and staff members.
