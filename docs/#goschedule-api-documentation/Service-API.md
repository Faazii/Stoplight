# Service-API

## Service Introduction

Services are methods to deliver value to the customers and act as the service provider’s roles for service consumers to schedule their appointments at their best available time.

## Services that you can create using GoSchedule API:
## 1:1 Appointment Service:
One-On-One Appointment service is usually for a single attendee per time slot. It facilitates your clients to quickly make their reservations directly from your website based on their preferred time slot. One-on-One booking is primarily used by interviewers, therapists, personal trainers, pet care professionals, government and embassies, and all other individual appointment-based businesses. 
With GoSchedule’s 1:1 Appointment Service API, you will be able to get, define your service, add your location and duration of the appointment, and associate it with cost and staff members.
